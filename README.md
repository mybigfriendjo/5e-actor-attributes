# Actor Attribute List

Lists all Attributes of an Actor Sheet for use in Descriptions.

Inspired by [Actor Attribute Lists](https://github.com/relick/FoundryVTT-Actor-Attribute-Lists) Module.

## Installation

1. Open the Add-on Modules tab in the Configuration and Setup dialog.
2. Click Install Module and search for "Actor Attribute List", or use the following manifest URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mybigfriendjo/actor-attribute-list/main/module.json`
3. Install the module and activate it for your World using the checkbox in the 'Manage Modules' Dialog.

## Usage

The module adds a new Header Button to the Actor Sheet called "Show Attributes".

Clicking it opens a new Window with all Attributes of the Actor Sheet in a table. The table is divided into sections for each type of attribute. Filtering is possible by typing into the search bar at the top of the window. It searches both the Attribute Name and the Attribute Value.

From there you can copy the Attribute Names for use in Text and Descriptions.

Implemented Systems are below. Adding additional Systems can be done depending on respective complexity.

If you want a system added, an optional but very helpful step would be confirming that the descriptions of a system are actually enriched to use attributes in the first place. You can do so in the respective game channel in foundry's discord and it might save you the time to open an Issue. [FoundryVTT Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt)

If you get confirmation or are unsure, feel free to open an Issue and i will look into it and add the system if and when i can.
